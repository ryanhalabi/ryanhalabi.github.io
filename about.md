I'm a recent PhD graduate from the Applied Mathematics department at UC Davis.  Since graduation I've immersed myself in learning as much about programming as I can.

My current projects are 

* [Analyzing allrecipes.com user and recipe data](https://github.com/ryanhalabi/AllRecipes) 

* [Starcraft AI](https://github.com/ryanhalabi/SCAI)


When I'm not stuck in staring contests with my cats Roland and Sylow I can usually be found parsing the documentation of a Python package.
