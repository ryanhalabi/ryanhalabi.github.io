title: Webscraping AllRecipes.com with Python

When you're looking to enter the field of Data Science, one of the things hammered into you is the importance of having projects you can present and discuss with employers.  One of the ways to accomplish this is to work with a Kaggle data set to demonstrate your skills in machine learning.  

While Kaggle problems are by no means trivial, the attitudes of people from industry seem to be a bit dismissive.  Data Scientists seem to spend the majority of their time getting the data they need and processing it into a usable format with applying machine learning algorithms being the last step.

Over the past few months I've struggled to find a project that could satisfy the following requirements:
- Nontrivial data collection <br>
- Broad enough to allow several different approaches<br>
- Something I could be passionate about<br>

Interstingly enough, it was the third point that proved the hardest.  In the past month however I finally discovered my true calling, analyzing allrecipes.com!i

While this is something that has already been done ([a link][1] [1]:http://www.princeton.edu/~jmcohen/recipe-recommendation.pdf"Link").  I feel the it satisfies the above criteria.  

My plan is
1) Collection user and recipe data<br>
2) Store it appropriately<br>
3) Create visualizations<br>
4) Applying machine learning<br>
5) Produce a WebApp<br>

So far I've only tackled step 1, but like any legit Data Scientist would say, thats the hard part right?
