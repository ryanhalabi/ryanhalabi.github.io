title: Analyzing AllRecipes.com

While looking for a job in Data Science, one of the things hammered into me is the importance of having projects you can present and discuss with employers.

While Iâ€™ve worked on Kaggle problems in the past, the attitudes of people from industry seem to be a bit dismissive.  Data Scientists seem to spend the majority of their time getting the data they need and processing it into a usable format with applying machine learning algorithms being the last step, this is the inverse of the Kaggle problem set up.

Keeping this in mind, I've struggled to find a project that could satisfy the following requirements:

* Nontrivial data collection 

* Broad enough to allow several different approaches

* Something I could be passionate about

Interestingly enough, it was the third point that proved the hardest to satisfy.  In the end, it was my baser desires for food that led me to my project: analyzing allrecipes.com.

My plan is to

1. Collect user and recipe data

2. Store it appropriately

3. Create visualizations

4. Applying machine learning

5. Produce a WebApp


So far I've only tackled step 1 (which my next post will discuss), but like any legit Data Scientist would say, thats the hard part right?
