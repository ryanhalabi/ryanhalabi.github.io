title: Analyzing AllRecipes.com

While learning about Data Science, I’ve heard over and over about the importance of not just learning, but applying what you’ve learned to create projects.  To exercise my skills in Machine Learning I’ve worked on Kaggle problems, however the Data Scientists I’ve spoken seem to be a bit dismissive.  

Instead of creating a fancy new machine learning algorithm, they’ve told me that they spend the majority of their time getting the data they need and processing it into a usable format.

Keeping this in mind, I've struggled to find a project to work on that satisfies the following requirements:

* Nontrivial data collection 

* Broad enough to allow several different approaches

* Something I could get excited about

While searching, it was the third point that proved the hardest to satisfy.  In the end, it was my baser desires that led me to my project: analyzing recipe and user data from AllRecipes.com.

My plan is to

1. Collect user and recipe data

2. Store it appropriately

3. Create visualizations

4. Applying machine learning

5. Produce a WebApp


So far I've only tackled step 1 (which my next post will discuss), but like any legit Data Scientist would say, thats the hard part right?
